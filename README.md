Routine is an API framework for building efficient, scalable .Net server-side applications. It enables you to quickly create APIs from backend systems such as SOAP or REST services. This feature enables you to easily that invoke web services without having in-depth knowledge of the web service. It makes it easy for developers to define, build and consume APIs.

Routine makes use of HTTP Server frameworks like [Gazel](https://gazel.io/). It provides a level of abstraction above these frameworks, but can also expose their APIs directly to the developer. This allows for easy use of the myriad third-party modules which are available for each platform.
